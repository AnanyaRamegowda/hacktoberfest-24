# Contributing to Hacktoberfest'24 Official Website Repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Hacktoberfest'24 Official Website repository! We are thrilled to have you as part of this collaborative effort led by **Google Developer Groups on Campus Graphic Era University** and our partner **Vaunt.dev**.

This repository offers a unique **2-Tier Contribution System**, which provides flexibility to contribute to our core repository or any open-source project of your choice.

---

## 1. Contribution Tiers

### Tier 1: Contribute to the Core Repository
For this tier, contributors work directly on the core repository of the Hacktoberfest event. Here's how to get started:

- **Find an Issue**: Go to the [Issues tab](../../issues) and search for issues with `[ISSUE]` in the title.
  - Maintainers will regularly update and label issues with `[ISSUE]`. You can also create a new issue with `[ISSUE]` in the title if you find a bug or a feature request.
  
- **Work on the Issue**: Once you've found an issue you'd like to work on, please comment on it to inform the maintainers that you're taking it up.

- **Submit a Pull Request**: After you've implemented the fix or feature, submit a pull request using the following naming convention:
  ```
  pr-add-<name>-<PR number>
  ```
  Example: `pr-add-johndoe-123`

### Tier 2: Contribute to External Repositories
In this tier, participants contribute to **ANY external repository** they are interested in. Follow these steps:

1. **Find an External Repository**: Choose any repository of your choice to contribute to.

2. **Get a Pull Request Merged**: Work on an issue or feature in the external repository and get your pull request merged successfully.

3. **Create an Issue in Our Repository**: 
    - Go to the [Issues tab](../../issues) in this repository.
    - Create an issue titled `[PR EXTERNAL] <your name>`.
    - In the issue, provide the following information:
        - Your Name
        - GitHub Username
        - PR Number
        - Link to the PR
        - A brief description of your contribution.

4. **Get Approval**: Our maintainers will verify your external contribution. Once it's approved, they will instruct you to:
    - Create a pull request against your own issue.
    -  Add a new file in `.js` in  `src/participants/` folder format (explained below).

## 2. Updating the Participants Log

 ### Here's how to add  file:

1. **Navigate to `src/participants/`**: 
   - This is where your contribution details will be added.

2. **Add your avatar/image**: 
   - Place your avatar (in `.png` or `.jpg` format) inside the `src/participants/avatars/img/` folder. Name the image file as `<yournameImg>.png`.

3. **Create a new file in `src/participants/` folder**: 
   - Name the file `yourName.js`.

4. **Import your avatar image**: 
   - Inside the newly created `<yourName.js>` file, import your avatar image from the `avatars/img` folder:

   ```js
   import <yournameImg> from "./avatars/img/yournameImg.png(or.jpg)";
   ```
5. **Add your contribution details**: 
   - If this is your first contribution, format your file as follows:

   ```js
   import <yournameImg> from "./avatars/img/<yourname>.png";

   const yourName = { 
     id: "2", // Unique ID
     name: "Your Name", 
     university: "University name", 
     img: yournameImg, 
     pr: [1], 
     prLink: ['#prLink1']
   };

   export default yourName;
   ```

6. **If you have multiple contributions**: 
   - If you already have a previous entry and are making a new contribution, simply update the `pr` array and `prLink` array as shown below:

   ```js
   const yourName = { 
     id: "2",
     name: "Your Name", 
     university: "University Name", 
     img: yourname, 
     pr: [1, 2], 
     prLink: ['#prLink1', '#prLink2']
   };
   ```

7. **Export your file**: 
   - Ensure your file is exported at the end:

   ```js
   export default yourName;
   ``` 

 - After successfully completing these steps our maintainers will approve your pull request and then your name will be shown in the leaderboard.
