## How to Contribute

Hacktoberfest'24 encourages contributions from everyone, regardless of their experience level. You can choose between two different contribution tiers:

### Tier 1: Core Repository Contributions

In this tier, you contribute directly to the official Hacktoberfest'24 core repository. Follow these steps:

1. **Find an Issue**: Check the [Issues tab](../../issues) and look for issues with `[ISSUE]` in the title. These are curated by the maintainers.
2. **Create an Issue**: If you find a bug or want to propose a feature, you can create a new issue with `[ISSUE]` in the title.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you've made the necessary changes, submit a pull request following this naming convention:
    ```
    pr-add-<your-name>-<PR-number>
    ```
    Example: `pr-add-johndoe-123`.

### Tier 2: External Repository Contributions

You also have the freedom to contribute to any **external open-source repository** of your choice. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Choose an External Repository**: Find an open-source repository you want to contribute to.
2. **Get Your PR Merged**: Submit a pull request to the external repository and get it merged successfully.
3. **Create an Issue in This Repo**: Once your external PR is merged, head over to the [Issues tab](../../issues) in this repository, and create an issue titled `[PR EXTERNAL] <your name>`.
4. **Submit Your Details**: In your issue, provide the following information:
    - Your Name
    - GitHub Username
    - PR Number
    - Link to the PR
    - A brief description of your contribution
5. **Update Participants Log**: Once verified by a maintainer, you will be instructed to add a new file in `.js` format (see below for more details).

## Leaderboard and Participants Log

After your contribution (either in Tier 1 or Tier 2) has been successfully verified, you will be featured on our **Leaderboard**! Here's how to add  file:

1. **Navigate to `src/participants/`**: This is where your contribution details will be added.
   
2. **Add your avatar/image**: Place your image (in `.png` format) inside the `src/participants/avatars/img/` folder. Name it as `<yourName>.png`.

3. **Create a new file in `src/participants/` folder**: 
   - Name the file `<yourname>.js`.
   
4. **Import your avatar image**: 
   - Inside the newly created `<yourname>.js` file, import your avatar image from the `avatars/img` folder:
     ```js
     import <yourNameImg> from "./avatars/img/<yourName>.png";
     ```

5. **Add your contribution details**: If this is your first contribution, format your file as follows:
    ```js
    import <yourNameImg> from "./avatars/img/<yourName>.png";

    const <yourName> = { 
      id: "<your ID number>",
      name: "<your name>", 
      university: "<Your University Name>", 
      img: <yourNameImg>, 
      pr: [1], 
      prLink: ['#prLink']
    };

    export default <yourName>;
    ```

6. **If you have already made previous contributions**, **do not create a new file**. Instead, add your new PR number and PR link to your existing file. For example:
    ```js
    const <yourName> = { 
      id: "2",
      name: "John Doe", 
      university: "Graphic Era Hill University", 
      img: johnDoeImg, 
      pr: [1, 2], 
      prLink: ['#link1', '#link2']
    };
    ```

   If you now have a new PR (PR number: 3, PR link: `#link3`), you would update the `pr` and `prLink` arrays like this:
    ```js
    const <yourName> = { 
      id: "2",
      name: "John Doe", 
      university: "Graphic Era Hill University", 
      img: johnDoeImg, 
      pr: [1, 2, 3], 
      prLink: ['#link1', '#link2', '#link3']
    };

    export default <yourName>;
    ```

7. **Export your file**: Make sure to export your data at the end using the following command:
    ```js
    export default <yourName>;
    ```

### Important Notes:
- Ensure the **PR number(s)** and **PR link(s)** are correct when you update your file.
- If youâ€™ve already contributed before, avoid creating a new file; just update the existing one.
- Follow the structure carefully to ensure your details are added correctly to the leaderboard.
